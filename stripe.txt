Basics of Using Stripe for Product and Payment Management
Here's how you can leverage Stripe for your product-related needs:

1. Stripe Dashboard
Product Creation and Management: Stripe's dashboard allows you to create and manage products and prices. This includes setting up one-time prices or recurring subscriptions if needed.
Inventory Management: While Stripe allows you to manage pricing and billing, it doesn't support inventory management. If inventory tracking is critical, you'll need to handle this aspect externally.
2. Products and Prices in Stripe
Products: In Stripe, a product is a thing you sell. It could be a physical item, a digital product, or a service. Each product can have multiple pricing models associated with it.
Prices: A Price object is linked to a product and tells Stripe how much and how often to charge for the product.
3. Using the Stripe API
List Products: You can retrieve and list products in your application by making API calls to Stripe.
Create Orders: When a user decides to purchase, you can create a payment session using Stripe’s API that corresponds to the selected product and its price.
Handle Payments: Use Stripe's Checkout Sessions or Payment Intents API to handle payments securely.
4. Integrating Stripe on the Frontend
Stripe.js and Stripe Elements: These tools help you collect payment details securely. Stripe.js is a library that Stripe hosts, and Elements are pre-built UI components that help you build your own custom payment forms while ensuring that payment details are directly sent to Stripe, never touching your servers.
5. Security and Compliance
PCI Compliance: By using Stripe Elements and not handling or storing credit card data on your servers, you're mostly offloading the responsibility of PCI compliance to Stripe.
Secure Transactions: Ensure all API interactions with Stripe are performed over HTTPS.
Example Workflow Using Stripe for a Simplified Checkout
Product Setup: Use the Stripe Dashboard to create your product and define the pricing.
Display Products: On your product page, fetch product details from Stripe via API and display them.
Purchase Initiation: When a user clicks "Buy Now", create a Checkout Session using Stripe’s API that includes the product ID and pricing information.
Payment Processing: Redirect the user to the Stripe Checkout page where they can enter their payment details securely.
Order Confirmation: After the payment is processed, Stripe will redirect the user back to your site to a confirmation page. Additionally, use webhooks to receive real-time updates on the transaction status.
