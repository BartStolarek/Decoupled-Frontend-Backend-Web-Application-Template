Simplified Flow with Immediate Checkout
Hereâ€™s how you can structure the user flow:

View Products
Users see a list of products. Each product has a "Buy Now" button instead of "Add to Cart".
Immediate Checkout
When a user clicks "Buy Now", they are taken directly to a checkout page where the product they selected is already added, and they can immediately fill out payment information.
Payment Integration
Integrate Stripe on the checkout page to handle payment. This can be done using Stripe Elements, which securely handles payment info without sensitive data touching your server.
Steps to Implement This Flow
Backend Setup
Stripe Configuration: Set up your Stripe account and obtain the necessary API keys.
Product Management: Have an API endpoint to serve the list of products.
Payment Intent API: Create an API endpoint to generate a Stripe payment intent for the product being purchased.
Frontend Development
Product Listing Page: Display all products with a "Buy Now" button for each.
Checkout Page:
This page should include:
Product summary (what the user is buying).
Payment form using Stripe Elements.
Payment Handling:
When the payment form is submitted, connect to Stripe to finalize the payment.
Display a confirmation message once the payment is successful or an error message if it fails.
Stripe Integration on Frontend
Load Stripe.js: Include Stripe.js to handle the payment securely.
Create Payment Form: Use Stripe Elements to build a form where users can enter their card details.
Handle Payment Submission:
Submit the payment details to Stripe and get a response.
Based on the response, show the user a success or failure message.
Security and Compliance
HTTPS: Ensure all your pages are served over HTTPS to secure user data.
PCI Compliance: By using Stripe Elements, you're delegating the handling of sensitive card data to Stripe, which helps in maintaining PCI compliance.
